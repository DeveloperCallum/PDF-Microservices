# Problem
PDFs are widely used for document storage and data sharing, yet extracting structured information, especially tables, can be **challenging and time-consuming**. Many organizations struggle to retrieve tabular data efficiently for further processing, often relying on manual methods or third-party tools that don't always give enough flexibility or in house tools to complete the extraction, and the tools that do are very expensive.

### Motivation for building this project:
1. **Learn How to Build Microservices** – By designing a modular system that processes PDFs, extracts tables, and serves structured data, I will explore the principles of **service decomposition, scalability, and communication**.
2. **Understand the Technology Choices** – Implementing messaging, REST APIs, and worker queues will give hands-on experience with **asynchronous processing, event-driven architecture**, and the practical trade-offs in system design.
